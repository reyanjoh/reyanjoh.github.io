      <p> Manage me, I'm a mess
        Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
        I wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
        I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
        Well I'm stuck in this fucking rut
        Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
        And I'm over getting older
        If I could just find the time
        Then I would never let another day go by
        I'm over getting old
        Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
        And I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass as I go nowhere
        And this is my reaction to everything I fear
        'Cause I've been going crazy, I don't wanna waste another minute here
        I make believe that I impress
        That every word, by design, turns a head
        I wanna feel reckless, wanna live it up just because
        I wanna feel weightless 'cause that would be enough
        If I could just find the time
        Then I would never let another day go by
        I'm over getting old
        Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
        And I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass as I go nowhere
        And this is my reaction to everything I fear
        'Cause I've been going crazy, I don't wanna waste another minute here
        This could be all that I've waited for
        (I've waited, I've waited for)
        And this could be everything I don't wanna dream anymore
        Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
        And I've been going crazy, I'm stuck in here
        Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year
        (It's gonna be my year)
        And I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass as I go nowhere
        (Go nowhere)
        And this is my reaction to everything I fear
        (Everything I fear)
        'Cause I've been going crazy, I don't want to waste another minute here


        Mayday situation overload
        I'm restless, obsessed with your future
        And all my worries they don't bother you
        Collected, you render me useless
        But I carry on
        Right now, I think that you think that I'm
        Half drunk, searching for something of
        Substance, casually dropping a line, designed
        To keep you next to me
        I can't awkwardly craft in advance
        I know, that you wouldn't fall for that
        You say "Shut up and take my hand"
        And we carry on
        I don't wanna say goodnight
        The city comes alive, when we're together
        Why can't Thursday last forever
        I don't wanna say goodnight
        I've never been so sure
        Just do it for the memories
        Do it for Baltimore
        And do it for me
        Hot damn, look at me now
        I'm all, caught up riding the high of my
        Good luck, casually dropping a line, designed,
        To keep you next to me
        I bet you never thought you would fall again
        So much for keeping this, just friends
        Shut up and kiss me now
        And we carry on
        I don't wanna say goodnight
        The city comes alive, when we're together
        Why can't Thursday last forever
        I don't wanna say goodnight
        I've never been so sure
        Just do it for the memories
        Do it for Baltimore
        And do it for me
        (Do it for me)
        Mayday situation overload

        Time to lay claim to the evidence
        Fingerprints sell me out but our footprints' washed away
        From the docks downtown
        It's been getting late for days
        And I feel myself deserving of a little time off
        We can kick it, hang for hours
        And just mouth off about the world
        And how we know it's going straight to hell
        Pass me another bottle, honey
        The Jager's so sweet
        But if it keeps you around, then I'm down
        Meet me on Thames Street, I'll take you out
        Though I'm hardly worth your time
        In the cold you look so fierce
        But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
        We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
        And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
        Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
        But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
        I should have known better than to call you out
        (On a night like this, night like this)
        If not for you, I know I'd tear this place to the ground
        (But I'm alright like this, alright like this)
        I'm gonna roll the dice before you sober up and get gone
        I'm always in over my head
        Thames Street, I'll take you out
        Though I'm hardly worth your time
        In the cold you look so fierce
        But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
        We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
        And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
        Fall in the grave, I've been digging myself
        But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
        Time to lay claim to the evidence
        Fingerprints sell me out
        But our footprints' washed away
        I'm guilty but I'm safe for one more day
        Overdressed and underage
        Do you really need to see an ID?
        This is embarrassing as hell
        But I can cover for it so well
        When we're six feet under the stars
        Thames Street, I'll take you out
        Though I'm hardly worth your time
        In the cold you look so fierce
        But I'm warming up because the tension's like a fire
        We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
        And like a bad movie I'll drop a line
        Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
        But there's room for two, six feet under the stars
        Six feet under the stars
        Six feet under the stars

        You've got me poppin' champagne, I'm at it again
        Caught up in the moment but not in the right way
        I'm falling in between, tearing up at the seams
        We're just aiming to please and aesthetics don't hurt one bit
        So follow me down, take this all the way
        Any way you want to
        Why don't you say so? I think I'm caught in between
        The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
        And my eyes, they despise you for who I am
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        You've got me thinking that lately I've been wishing
        The television set would show me more
        Than just a picture of the things I've grown to detest
        I strip down my dignity they can take all of me
        But they won't ever take what I still believe
        So follow me down, take this all the way
        Any way you want to
        Why don't you say so? I think I'm caught in between
        The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
        And my eyes, they despise you for who I am
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Give up and let go, I'm just a boy with a dream
        And you can take one look as I fall in between
        With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        I know, I know, I know
        That there's a place for me somewhere out there
        I know, I know, I know
        That there's a place for me somewhere out there
        Why don't you say so? I think I'm caught in between
        The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
        My eyes, they despise you for who I am
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Give up and let go, I'm just a boy with a dream
        And you can take one look as I fall in between
        With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?
        Why don't you say so? Why don't you say so?

        Why do all the monsters come out at night?
        Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
        Why do I run back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
        Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
        Tunnel vision's got me feeling like you're the only one I see
        But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
        In my lonely luxury
        I'm wondering why do all the monsters come out at night?
        Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
        Why do I run back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
        Strung out like laundry on every line
        Why do I come back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
        I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
        I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
        Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking
        So, tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
        Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
        You can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
        I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
        I'm wondering why do all the monsters come out at night?
        Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
        Why do I run back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
        Strung out like laundry on every line
        Why do I come back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
        Even without you, I still feel dead
        Why do I run back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
        Even without you, I still feel dead
        Why do I run back to you
        Like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
        I'm wondering why do all the monsters come out at night?

        Shorty said she wants to run away
        Says I look like a boy she used to date
        Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs (Not interested, girl)
        Put her tongue all up in my ear (Gross)
        Almost made me spill my beer (Oh shit!)
        She's up and ready to go but I don't care (Pssh, whatever)
        'Cause I'm in the zone
        Turned off my phone
        I've got my own agenda
        I feel like dancing tonight
        I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
        It doesn't matter where
        I don't care if people stare
        'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
        Everybody gettin' kinda crunk
        I think some dude just grabbed my junk (Whoa)
        Now I know how Kesha must be feelin' (Like, what if we are the aliens?)
        Bros tried to turn me upside down
        I put a keg tap to my mouth
        But that's okay
        I'm dancing on the ceiling (Ahhh)
        'Cause I've got the groove
        I'll bust a move
        Just try and stop me
        I feel like dancing tonight
        I'm gonna party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
        It doesn't matter where
        I don't care if people stare
        'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
        Somebody call the police (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
        I think they're coming to get me
        They said
        "You've got the right to remain on the dance floor
        So show us what you've got
        'Cause you know that you've got more!"
        I feel like dancing tonight
        I came to party like it's my civil right (Everybody get kinda awesome)
        It doesn't matter where
        I don't care if people stare
        'Cause I feel like dancing tonight
        Oh, one more time!
        I feel like dancing tonight (I feel like dancing)
        I'm gonna (dancing) party like it's my civil right (Oh-Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh)
        It doesn't matter where
        I don't care if people stare
        'Cause I feel like dancing tonight (Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
        I feel like dancing tonight (Ha Ha)


        I woke up in a stranger's bed
        With pins and needles in my head
        And the clock ticking off the wall
        Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
        I don't even know myself
        I wish I could be someone else
        But I don't have a clue at all
        Oh, yeah
        I'm sinking
        You're wading
        I'm thinking something's gotta give
        Wake me up
        Say enough is enough
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        Pull me out of this sinking town
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        Maybe I'm a fucking waste
        Filling up the empty space
        I've been here way too long
        Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
        I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
        Living on my last paycheck
        I'm a cliché in a song
        And everybody's singing along
        I'm sinking (I'm thinking)
        You're wading (you're wading)
        I'm thinking something's gotta give
        Wake me up
        Say enough is enough
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        Pull me out of this sinking town
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        Someone please come pull me out
        From the shadow of my doubt
        Wake me up
        I'm falling
        Wake me up
        Say enough is enough
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        Pull me out of this sinking town
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give
        I'm sinking (I'm thinking)
        You're wading (you're wading)
        I'm thinking something's gotta give (something's gotta give)
        Pull me out of this sinking town
        I'm dying to live
        Something's gotta give


        I got your picture, I'm coming with you
        Dear Maria, count me in
        There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
        And I'm the pen
        When the lights go up
        I wanna watch the way you take the stage by storm
        The way you wrap those boys around your finger
        Go on and play the leader
        'Cause you know it's what you're good at
        The low road for the fast track, make every second last
        'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you
        Dear Maria, count me in
        There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
        And I'm the pen
        Make it count
        When I'm the one who's selling you out
        'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
        Calling your name from the crowd
        Doesn't that mean
        You'll be the showgirl of the home team
        I'll be the narrator
        Telling another tale of the American dream
        I see your name in lights
        We could make you a star
        Girl, we'll take the world by storm
        It isn't that hard
        'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you
        Dear Maria, count me in
        There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
        And I'm the pen

        When I'm the one who's selling you out
        'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
        Calling your name from the crowd, whoa
        Take a breath, don't it sound so easy?
        Never had a doubt, now I'm going crazy
        Watching from the floor
        Take a breath and let the rest come easy
        Never settle down 'cause the cash flow leaves me
        Always wanting more
        'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you
        Dear Maria, count me in
        There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
