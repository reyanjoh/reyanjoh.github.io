The beautiful part about this piece is the  phrase Ritz uttered to Rach when he proposed, ‚ÄúTayo naman, Mrs. San Juan.‚Äù You'll also notice origami flowers as part of the decorations, because back when they were college sweethearts, Ritz surprised Rach with a dozen paper tulips. How romantic is that?! As for the reception styling, a couple of geometric centerpieces were included as a nod to the venue where Ritz popped the question.
